## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Core Systems
1. **Vehicle System**
   ```javascript
   class Car {
     // Physics properties
     speed, acceleration, handling
     // Visual components
     body, wheels, lights
     // Game mechanics
     boost, collision, boundaries
   }
   ```

2. **Environment System**
   ```javascript
   class Game {
     // Scene management
     scene, camera, renderer
     // Environment setup
     track, props, lighting
     // Game state
     gameState, collisionObjects
   }
   ```

3. **Input System**
   ```javascript
   class InputHandler {
     // Keyboard controls
     forward, backward, left, right
     // Special actions
     boost, brake
   }
   ```

### Physics Implementation
- **Movement**
  - Speed-based acceleration
  - Directional movement using vectors
  - Rotation based on steering input
- **Collision**
  - Radius-based collision detection
  - Response calculation
  - Speed reduction on impact
- **Boundaries**
  - Distance-based boundary checking
  - Position correction
  - Speed reduction on boundary hit

### Visual Effects
1. **Vehicle Effects**
   - Dynamic wheel rotation
   - Boost flame particles
   - Headlight and taillight illumination
2. **Environment Effects**
   - Dynamic lighting per theme
   - Fog effects
   - Shadow casting and receiving
